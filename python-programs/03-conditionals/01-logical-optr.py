# There are three most important logical operator

# AND, OR, NOT 

# AND:
# syntax [condition1 and codition2]
# if both the condition are true then result is true.
# if any one condition is false it is false.
# if the first condition is false it will not check the condition2 because it is now clear that whatever is the condition2 , the overall result gonna be false.
# if the first conditin is true then the answer will depend on the condition2 and will must check it.

# OR:
# syntax [condition1 or condition2]
# if both the condition are false then result is false.
# if any one condition is true result is true.
# if the first condition is true it will not check the condition2 because it is now clear that whatever is the condition2 , the overall result gonna be true.
# if the first conditin is false then the answer will depend on the condition2 and will must check it.

# NOT:
# syntax [not condition]
# it reverse the result
# id condition is True it will result False and vice versa.

# other are also important but are very obvious
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
