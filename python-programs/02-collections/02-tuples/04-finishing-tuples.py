# looping through tuple is same

# joining tuple is same
# by plus operator

# one thing is that we can multiply tuple to increase its length by xNumber of times

myTuple = (1, 2, 3)
twiseTuple = myTuple*2
thriceTuple = myTuple*3


print(myTuple)
print(twiseTuple)
print(thriceTuple)

# count() returns number of ocurrence of specified item
print(thriceTuple.count(1))

# index() return the first occurence of specified item
print(thriceTuple.index(1))

# That's it for tuples
