# Python is a interpreted programming language.
# It is a High level programming language.
# It's syntax are very easy to learn and are like the English sentences (mostly)
# Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
# Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
# MOST IMPORTANT : Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

print("Hello World") # Used to print things  in the console.

print("Hello Everyone", "How are you?") # This will print two sentence and is valid code
# Install Python interpreter from https://www.python.org/
# Install a code editor. My preference https://code.visualstudio.com/
# Go to the extension setion of VS Code and add two extensions 
# 1. Prettier: Helps you to format your code.
# 2. Python: By microsoft.

# Now you are good to go.
# One better thing is to learn a bit of Git and then create your python folder
# and put it on the Github so that you can revise faster
# as I am doing this.
