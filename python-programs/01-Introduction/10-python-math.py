# Python has built in math function which we can use.
# It also has a math module that contain more constants and methods

# Built-in math function:

myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print(max(myList))
print(min(myList))
print(abs(10- 32))
print(pow(2, 3))


import math

print(math.sqrt(36))
print(math.log10(100))
print(math.isnan(123))
